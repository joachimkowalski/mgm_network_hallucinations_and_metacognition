R code for network analyses presented in manuscript "Examining auditory hallucinations and attention in schizophrenia patients according to the metacognitive model" authored by Joachim Kowalski et al. 
If you liked it and used the code in your analyses, it would be great if you referenced/cited the paper: xxx (here I will put DOI, when published). 
Thanks!
